# Development Process and Problem-solving Strategy

For the start, I draw a framework about my program as two part. One part is about the user,
user can create their account with the sign-up, sign-in, change-password and sign-out.
Other part is about the main function. Every user can create their own teams with the name,
date and comments if they want. for the team, user can only see themselves team and
update or delete them. User can also check all the heros information and add some heros into
the teams.

And then, start from the html and then focus on the JavaScript also the CSS. After all of these,
I add the API(sent and recieve data with server).

The Strategy I use to complete this program is trying to sepertate the big problem into some small
problems, And make a planning schedule.

Make git commit after everytime I finish a small function.

# Unsolved Problems

- Add some animation as start movie
- Add some spider chart to show the heros ability
- Add background music
